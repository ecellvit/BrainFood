              This brain teaser challenges your mental vitality and flexibility
              to adapt to changes.
            </b>
            <br />
            <b>Rules</b>
            <p>
              1. There will be a grid of numbers which reshuffle after every
              click.
            </p>
            <p>2. Numbers in the grid appear randomly from 0 to 24.</p>
            <p>
              3. A number appears separately, you find and click that number in
              the grid within 5 seconds.
            </p>
            <p>4. For every wrong click, you commence from zero.</p>
            <p>5. You win the game when you reach the last number, 24.</p>

              1. Click on the "text" of the color that is called out and not the
              color in which the text is written.
              <br /> For example, if "blue" is called out you click on the word
              "blue" ignoring the color in which it is written.
            </p>
            <p>2. You score a point for every correct click.</p>
            <p>3. For every wrong click, you're back to zero.</p>
